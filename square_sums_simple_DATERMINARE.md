# SquareSumsSimple DATERMINARE

## Task

This is a simple version of harder Square Sums. Square sums

Write function square_sums_row (or squareSumsRow/SquareSumsRow depending on language rules) that, given integer number
N (in range 2..43), returns array of integers 1..N arranged in a way, so sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a square.

Solution is valid if and only if following two criteria are met:

- Each number in range 1..N is used once and only once.
- Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect square.

## Example

For N=15 solution could look like this:
[ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ]

## Verification

All numbers are used once and only once. When sorted in ascending order array looks like this:

[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]

Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect square:

```bash
   16    16     16     16     16     16     16
   /+\   /+\    /+\    /+\    /+\    /+\    /+\
[ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ]
      \+/    \+/    \+/    \+/    \+/    \+/    \+/
       9     25      9     25      9     25      9
```

9 = 3*3 16 = 4*4 25 = 5*5

If there is no solution, return false (or, None in Scala). For example if N=5, then numbers 1,2,3,4,5 cannot be put into
square sums row: 1+3=4, 4+5=9, but 2 has no pairs and cannot link [1,3] and [4,5]
Have fun!
